# twitch-resizer

Script that changes the size of images to adapt them to Twitch.tv accepted formats (badges, emotes).

Twitch now does this natively for emotes but not, for example, with custom Points rewards icons, so I still use it from time to time.

I also use this repo to test GitHub functionality such as tags and releases.

This was implemented using [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow).
